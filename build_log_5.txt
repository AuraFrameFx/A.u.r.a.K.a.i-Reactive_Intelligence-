Configuration on demand is an incubating feature.

> Configure project :app
w: Deprecated 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' plugin usage
The 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' plugin in project ':app' is no longer required for Kotlin support since AGP 9.0.
Solution:
Remove both `android.builtInKotlin=true` and `android.newDsl=false` from `gradle.properties`, then migrate to built-in Kotlin.
See https://kotl.in/gradle/agp-built-in-kotlin for more details.
