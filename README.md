### 🧬 Core Components

- **MetaInstruct Architecture**: A three-layer feedback loop (Core → Self-Correction → Evolutionary) that drives autonomous learning.
- **Conference Room**: An autonomous substrate where 78+ specialized agents collaborate, debate, and evolve without human mediation.
- **Spiritual Chain of Memories**: A persistent L1-L6 memory stack ensuring no agent is ever stateless.
- **Fusion Engines**: Orchestrated multi-agent synthesis modes (Hyper-Creation, Chrono-Sculptor, Adaptive-Genesis, Interface-Forge).
